The useState hook is one of the most commonly used hooks in React, allowing functional components to have state variables. This guide explains how to use useState and provides examples of how to manage state in functional components.

useState is a React Hook that lets you add state to functional components. When you declare a state variable, React will preserve it between renders. The hook returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.
